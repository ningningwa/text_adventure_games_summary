        "> We introduce a large-scale crowdsourced text adventure game as a research platform for studying grounded dialogue. In it, agents can perceive, emote, and act while conducting dialogue with other agents. Models and humans can both act as characters within the game. We describe the results of training state-of-the-art generative and retrieval models in this setting. We show that in addition to using past dialogue, these models are able to effectively use the state of the underlying world to condition their predictions. In particular, we show that grounding on the details of the local environment, including location descriptions, and the objects (and their affordances) and characters (and their previous actions) present within it allows better predictions of agent behavior and dialogue. We analyze the ingredients necessary for successful grounding in this setting, and how each of these factors relate to agents that can talk and act successfully.\n",

As far as the eye can see there is muddy water in a circular basin with lily pads floating in it. On the pads, giant toads jump back and forth making gurgling, croaking sounds. As you wade deeper into Toad Hollow, the water comes up to your waist and you see the flash of a fin. There is legend that a creature lives in the center of Toad Hollow that is half human, half monster. Not even the strongest knight has been brave enough to examine it. The fin disappears back underwater but there is a red glint suggesting eyes are watching you. When you reach the other side of the basin, you crawl into another drainage pipe and feel relieved that you're out of this place.\n",

Even the wall above the door as you enter is a shelf full of books of all sorts. The smell of paper and some mold (they are rather old books) permeates the air. A large overstuffed settee is faced by a short table and across from that are two matching chair. All are brown in color and look to be extremely comfortable. The walls were once stone grey in color but the shelves totally cover them. The floor is covered in a lush, brownish rug that looks and feels more like fur. There are books piled on the floor by the chair and the short table is covered with them as well. Under the window at the far end of the room is a huge desk that is covered with papers and a few books. A candle holder sets on one corner with a partially melted candle still in it.\n",

Dragon Lift looks really drab on the outside. It is a dull brown, boxy looking building but has a red awning proclaiming Dragon Lift in golden script. Inside Dragon Lift, Joel is waiting in his tattered smock to rent you a dragon that you'll swoop around the clouds on. When you enter the door to Dragon Lift, you realize it's bigger than you imagined and feels like a barn with dragons in stalls that you can examine.\n",

A bed made of cloth that is both soft and warm hangs in the corner of the tent.  It seems to perfectly fit there, as though it was grown from the tent walls instead of skillfully placed.  The floor is carpeted with impossibly vibrant rugs, the likes of which no mortal eye has seen, and the walls of the tent rise up so high that the ceiling cannot be seen.  A brazier glows softly, and above it hangs a golden teapot.  Vapors rising from its spout waft into the space, smelling of cinnamon and spices.

You enter Toad Hollow through a drainage pipe that you have to crawl through. Once inside Toad Hollow, you can stand up, but you still don't feel comfortable with your surroundings. As far as the eye can see there is muddy water in a circular basin with lily pads floating in it. On the pads, giant toads jump back and forth making gurgling, croaking sounds. As you wade deeper into Toad Hollow, the water comes up to your waist and you see the flash of a fin. There is legend that a creature lives in the center of Toad Hollow that is half human, half monster. Not even the strongest knight has been brave enough to examine it. The fin disappears back underwater but there is a red glint suggesting eyes are watching you. When you reach the other side of the basin, you crawl into another drainage pipe and feel relieved that you're out of this place.\n",

As far as the eye can see there is muddy water in a circular basin with lily pads floating in it. On the pads, giant toads jump back and forth making gurgling, croaking sounds. As you wade deeper into Toad Hollow, the water comes up to your waist and you see the flash of a fin. There is legend that a creature lives in the center of Toad Hollow that is half human, half monster. Not even the strongest knight has been brave enough to examine it.
